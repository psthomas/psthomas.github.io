I was watching a World Bank [presentation](http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2015/09/29/should-we-just-give-people-cash) on cash transfers the other day and came across a pretty funny cartoon about Mount Stupid.  This curve partially describes the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), and I think it's an important concept to keep in mind when starting a blog.

I'm curious about a number of topics including economics, public health, and life sciences research.  Unfortunately, I don’t have much academic expertise in any of these fields, and there aren't enough hours in a day to keep up with the most recent developments.  

When faced with these limitations, one can either **(a)** choose a subject, become an expert, and stick to this topic, or **(b)** build a more shallow understanding of a variety of subjects and risk ending up on Mt. Stupid.  I have generally chosen route **(a)** in life, but I still feel my curiosity pulling me towards route **(b)** regularly.  So when I speculate beyond my areas of expertise, I will generally follow these rules:  

## Ground Rules

1. Write with humility — I will try to be aware and honest about what I don’t know.
2. Justify my stances with quality evidence
3. Draw from a broad variety of sources, and try to summarize their views fairly  
4. Rely on the judgement of experts when I’m out of my depth

If I break these rules, call me out in the comments!  


## Onward    

I don’t want to go too overboard with rules - this *is* a blog after all.  A person has to risk embarrassment in order to come up with new ideas, and making mistakes is part of the learning process.  In the end, then, I think having the restraint of these rules will help flatten Mt. Stupid, making for more of a gradual ascent to knowledge.
