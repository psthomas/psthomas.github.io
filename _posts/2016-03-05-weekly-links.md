### [Markets Don't Work as Well as We Thought](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-09/financial-markets-don-t-work-as-well-as-we-thought)

> But what if there is no deep underlying force making small stocks -- or value stocks, or momentum stocks -- more risky? What if these stocks earned better-than-average returns in the past not because they are riskier, but because investors just overlooked them, or were biased against them?

### [Seeing Economic Patterns That Don't Exist](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-02/we-get-fooled-by-economic-patterns-that-don-t-exist)

> A similar result was famously demonstrated by economist Larry Summers in 1982. He showed that it’s possible that even if the stock market has bubbles that appear and disappear over the course of about six years, it’s statistically impossible to identify these bubbles in a 50-year data sample. Instead, you’d need more than 1,000 years to have a hope of getting a definitive answer. That was a blow to efficient markets theory, because it showed that statistics couldn’t tell an efficient market from one with bubbles. When the length of a cycle is so long that history only contains a few of them, you’ll never pick the cycle out from random noise.

### [The problem with evidence based policies](http://www.readability.com/m?url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/evidence-based-policy-problems-by-ricardo-hausmann-2016-02)

> My main problem with RCTs is that they make us think about interventions, policies, and organizations in the wrong way. As opposed to the two or three designs that get tested slowly by RCTs (like putting tablets or flipcharts in schools), most social interventions have millions of design possibilities and outcomes depend on complex combinations between them. This leads to what the complexity scientist Stuart Kauffman calls a “rugged fitness landscape.”  
>
> Getting the right combination of parameters is critical. This requires that organizations implement evolutionary strategies that are based on trying things out and learning quickly about performance through rapid feedback loops, as suggested by Matt Andrews, Lant Pritchett and Michael Woolcock at Harvard’s Center for International Development.

### [Has the randomized trial movement has put the auditors in charge of the R&D department?](http://chrisblattman.com/2016/02/25/13667/)

> Absolutely, organizations should be doing innovating through rigorous trial and error. And the case needs to be made, since many organizations don’t know how to do this.  
>
> But let’s be honest: most governments and NGOs did not have R&D departments that got hijacked by randomized trials. Most organizations I know were not doing much in the way of systematic or rigorous research of any kind. Outside one or two donors and development banks, the usual research result was a mediocre consulting report rigged to look good.


### [Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?](http://www.nber.org/digest/mar16/w21788.html)

[![curve]({{site.baseurl}}/images/scientists.jpg)](http://www.nber.org/digest/mar16/w21788.html)

> The findings confirm previous work showing that the number of articles by collaborators decreased substantially — by about 40 percent — after the death of a star scientist. Publication activity by non-collaborators increased by an average of 8 percent after the death of an elite scientist. By five years after the death, this activity of non-collaborators fully offset the productivity decline of collaborators. "These additional contributions are disproportionately likely to be highly cited," the researchers found. "They are also more likely to be authored by scientists who were not previously active in the deceased superstar's field."
>
> Few of the deceased scientists served as editors of academic journals or on committees overseeing the issuance of research grants, so the researchers rule out the possibility that the deceased scientists used their influence to limit who could or could not publish their work or receive grants within their field. Instead, they say, the evidence suggests that outsiders were reluctant to challenge the leadership within research areas in which an elite scientist was active. While entry occurs after a star's passing, it is not monolithic. Key collaborators left behind can regulate entry into the field through the control of intellectual, social, and resource barriers.
"While coauthors suffer after the passing of a superstar, it is not simply the case that star scientists in a competing lab assume the leadership mantle," the authors conclude. "Rather, the boost comes largely from outsiders who appear to tackle the mainstream questions within the field but by leveraging newer ideas that arise in other domains. This intellectual arbitrage is quite successful — the new articles represent substantial contributions, at least as measured by long-run citation impact."


### [Pressure to ‘publish or perish’ may discourage innovative research, UCLA study suggests](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/pressure-to-publish-or-perish-may-discourage-innovative-research-ucla-study-suggests)

> Researchers have long faced a natural tension and tradeoff when deciding whether to build on accumulated knowledge in a field or pursue a bold new idea that challenges established thinking. UCLA assistant professor of sociology Jacob Foster and his co-authors describe it as a conflict between “productive tradition” and “risky innovation.”    
>
> To study this tension, Foster and his colleagues assembled a database of more than 6.4 million scholarly publications in the fields of biomedicine and chemistry from 1934 to 2008. They then analyzed whether individual publications built on existing discoveries or created new connections — in effect, creating a map of the growing web of scientific knowledge. Finally, they correlated each of the two broad strategies with two types of reward: citations in subsequent research and more substantial recognition conferred by 137 different scholarly awards.  
>
> “Published papers that make a novel connection are rare but more highly rewarded,” said Foster, the study’s lead author. “So what accounts for scientists’ disposition to pursue tradition over innovation? Our evidence points to a simple explanation: Innovative research is a gamble whose payoff, on average, does not justify the risk. It’s not a reliable way to accumulate scientific reward.”  


### [242,000 Americans got a job last month. Here's why they're not celebrating](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/04/242000-americans-job-last-month-heres-why-not-celebrating)

> Granted, the disappearance of manufacturing is an ongoing historical trend, one that goes mostly unnoticed by those outside of factory towns except in the abstract, economic sense. It’s easy not to mourn “dirty jobs” – certainly no one reads Adam Smith and says “That pin factory job sounds great! Sign me up!” But today, the same workers who could once support a family at that pin factory are now working in retail stores and bars, scrambling to get by on erratic and part time schedules.
>
> Those workers haven’t changed – they haven’t become less educated, less skilled or less productive – but their bargaining power has. Those dirty jobs were largely unionized, and service sector jobs largely are not. This is at the heart of the part time, stagnant wage job recovery. More people are back to work, but not getting the hours they want, or the wages they need to get back what they lost in the recession.



### [Guided Internet-based vs. face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy for psychiatric and somatic disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25273302)

> Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been tested in many research trials, but to a lesser extent directly compared to face-to-face delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in which guided ICBT was directly compared to face-to-face CBT. Studies on psychiatric and somatic conditions were included. Systematic searches resulted in 13 studies (total N=1053) that met all criteria and were included in the review. There were three studies on social anxiety disorder, three on panic disorder, two on depressive symptoms, two on body dissatisfaction, one on tinnitus, one on male sexual dysfunction, and one on spider phobia. Face-to-face CBT was either in the individual format (n=6) or in the group format (n=7). We also assessed quality and risk of bias. Results showed a pooled effect size (Hedges' g) at post-treatment of -0.01 (95% CI: -0.13 to 0.12), indicating that guided ICBT and face-to-face treatment produce equivalent overall effects. Study quality did not affect outcomes. While the overall results indicate equivalence, there are still few studies for each psychiatric and somatic condition and many conditions for which guided ICBT has not been compared to face-to-face treatment. Thus, more research is needed to establish equivalence of the two treatment formats.



### [A 19-year-old made a free robot lawyer that has appealed $3 million in parking tickets](http://www.businessinsider.com/joshua-browder-bot-for-parking-tickets-2016-2)

> Since laws are publicly available, bots can automate some of the simple tasks that human lawyers have had to do for centuries. Browder's isn't even the first lawyer bot. The startup Acadmx's bot creates perfectly formatted legal briefs. The company Lex Machina does data mining on judges' records and makes predictions on what they will do in the future.  
>
> ”As a 19-year-old, I have coded the entirety of the robot on my own, and I think it does a reasonable job of replacing parking lawyers," he says. "I know there are thousands of programmers with decades more experience than me working on similar issues."

### [New Weapon in Day Laborers’ Fight Against Wage Theft: A Smartphone App](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/nyregion/new-weapon-in-day-laborers-fight-against-wage-theft-a-smartphone-app.html)

> After three years of planning, an immigrant rights group in Jackson Heights is set to start a smartphone app for day laborers, a new digital tool with many uses: Workers will be able to rate employers (think Yelp or Uber), log their hours and wages, take pictures of job sites and help identify, down to the color and make of a car, employers with a history of withholding wages. They will also be able to send instant alerts to other workers. The advocacy group will safeguard the information and work with lawyers to negotiate payment.  
>
> “It will change my life and my colleagues’ lives a good deal,” Omar Trinidad, a Mexican immigrant, said in Spanish through an interpreter. Mr. Trinidad is the lead organizer who helped develop the app.

### [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

There are issues with external validity, but still interesting: 

> As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’  
>
> Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.
