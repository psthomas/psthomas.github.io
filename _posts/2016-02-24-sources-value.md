I’m interested in many different fields and don’t have enough time to read the constant stream of content coming from each one.  This makes concise sources of information that cover the recent developments really important to me.  I generally look for a few characteristics in the content I draw from:

* Clear and concise communication
* Qualified authors 
* Valued by many other intelligent people 
* Fair representation of different viewpoints
 

It seems relatively easy to find good information about economics — [some](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/in-praise-of-econowonkery/) have even called this a golden age of economics blogging.  I find more difficult to find good sources when it comes to public health or life sciences research.  Part of this may be the nature of the fields — life scientists may be more specialized, making it more difficult to comment broadly about others’ findings.  Anyways, if anyone knows of other good sources, let me know!
