#### [Epistemic closure, even in systematic reviews](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/epistemic-closure-even-in-systematic-reviews/)

> Studies were more likely to be included if they supported the salt reduction hypothesis than if they contradicted it. Cherry picking, even in the “systematic” reviews.

#### [Describing People as Particles Isn’t Always a Bad Idea](http://nautil.us/issue/33/attraction/describing-people-as-particles-isnt-always-a-bad-idea)

> It’s now clear that economic markets show all the telltale signs, familiar to physicists, of being a system that is not in equilibrium. That means Gibbs’ statistical physics just isn’t the right model. What’s more, price fluctuations are best explained not as the aggregate of many random, independent decisions, ruffled by external shocks to the system—the standard model—but as largely the outcome of the internal, ever-active dynamics of the market, in which feedback makes decisions inter-dependent. 
>
> Big fluctuations such as over-valuations and crashes seem to come from herding effects: Everyone does what they see others doing. This is obvious enough from the real world, and it is a familiar idea to economists too—it is partly what Keynes had in mind with his “animal spirits.” Non-equilibrium economic models that allow for feedback and knock-on propagation of agents’ decisions can explain such things. 

#### [Bill Gates: The Next Outbreak? We’re not ready](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_disaster_we_re_not_ready?language=en#), and [The most predictable disaster in the history of the human race](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8660249/gates-flu-pandemic)

> The basic reason the disease could spread so fast is that human beings now move around so fast. Gates's modelers found that about 50 times more people cross borders today than did so in 1918. And any new disease will cross those borders with them — and will do it before we necessarily even know there is a new disease. Remember what Ron Klain said: "If you look at the H1N1 flu in 2009, it had spread around the world before we even knew it existed."  
>
> Gates's model showed that a Spanish flu–like disease unleashed on the modern world would kill more than 33 million people in 250 days. 
>
> "We've created, in terms of spread, the most dangerous environment that we've ever had in the history of mankind," Gates says. 

#### [Poverty and Measurement](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_bNHlWJ58R2are9T)

#### [European Tech Scene Begins to Feel Silicon Valley’s Woes](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/technology/european-tech-scene-begins-to-feel-silicon-valleys-woes.html)

> “Europe didn’t fly as high as Silicon Valley,” said Par-Jorgen Parson, general partner at the Swedish venture firm Northzone, an early backer of Spotify. “That means it also won’t fall as far, either.”

#### [Why one woman stole 47 million academic papers — and made them all free to read](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11024334/sci-hub-free-academic-papers)

> In creating Sci-Hub, Elbakyan basically mechanized something that already occurs: password sharing.
>
> Most university libraries have online portals for their students and faculty. Enter these portals with a university password, and voilà — all the world's scientific knowledge is at your fingertips.
>
> Before Sci-Hub, Elbakyan simply asked fellow researchers with access to those portals to fetch articles for her. Sci-Hub streamlines this process. When a Sci-Hub user requests an article, the site will try to log in to a university portal, using passwords that were reportedly donated, and grab the article. Once that's done, Sci-Hub will make a copy of the paper for its servers. That way, Sci-Hub won't have to go through a portal the next time someone needs a paper.
>
> "The goal is to collect all research papers ever published, and make them free," Elbakyan told the website Torrent Freak.
>
> And with 47 million papers, she's getting close.

#### [Technical interview performance is kind of arbitrary. Here’s the data.](http://blog.interviewing.io/technical-interview-performance-is-kind-of-arbitrary-heres-the-data/)

> Nevertheless, using these distributions, we did attempt to compute the probability that a candidate with a certain mean score would fail a single interview. . . The fact that people who are overall pretty strong (e.g. mean ~= 3) can mess up technical interviews as much as 22% of the time shows that there’s definitely room for improvement in the process, and this is further exacerbated by the general murkiness in the middle of the spectrum.
