# [Visualizations]({{site.baseurl}}/vis/)

Here's a collection of some of the visualizations I've made. For static ones, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) generally works well for me. If I need an interactive visualization, I'll generally use [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for simple situations and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) when more complex behavior is needed.
