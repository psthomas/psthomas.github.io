I have an academic background in biology and environmental engineering.  Recently, I have been learning some __Python__ and __JavaScript__, focusing mainly on web development.  I enjoy creating things using these two languages, which seem capable of building just about anything. 

My other interests include **economics**, **public health** and **life sciences research**.  I'll write about some of these topics when I know enough to be competent, otherwise I'll stick to summarizing the views of others.  



## Web Projects

 **TeXTmail**:   
A Flask web application for checking your email via text message. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/textmail)]  
**web-graph**:   
A Flask application that scrapes websites, indexes them, and creates a graph visualization of the linking structure. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/web-graph), [demo](http://web-graph.appspot.com/)]  
**React Todo**:  
A simple todo app written with React, Node, Express and Ajax. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/react-todo), [demo](http://psthomas.github.io/react-todo/)]   
**pstblog.com**:   
This site, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. Based on the [Minimal-Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/psthomas.github.io)]  
**crud-restaurant**:   
A CRUD web application for local restaurants built with Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/crud-restaurant)]  


## Data Projects

I like asking questions and trying to answer them with data.  My tools of choice are Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, D3.js, Requests and Beautiful Soup.  Most of these projects would be considered "data analysis" rather than "data science".

**Jupyter Notebooks**  
I have a number of notebooks on Jupyter NBViewer outlining most of the work I've done: [[source](https://gist.github.com/psthomas), [demo](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/psthomas)]  
**Visualizations**  
I'm a fan of using D3.js to create interactive visualizations.  A few of them are here: [[demo](https://bl.ocks.org/psthomas)]  
**Stacked Chart**:     
A public health data visualization built with D3.js. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/stackedchart-d3js), [demo](http://bl.ocks.org/psthomas/raw/427b4c4a9ca2770e6c32/)]  
**Obesity Viz**:  
A interactive D3 visualization showing global overweight and obesity trends from 1990 to 2013.  [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/transition-d3js), [demo](http://bl.ocks.org/psthomas/raw/3d206756f93fdfcec7919dfb42c4e6fe/)]  
**Optimal Transit London**:   
Using a genetic algorithm and the Google Distance Matrix API to find the optimal sightseeing route through London. [[source](https://github.com/psthomas/optimal-transit-London), [demo](http://psthomas.github.io/optimal-transit-London/)]
